                <h3>Major Information</h3>
                <p class="description">Completion of the B.S. in Information Technology and Web Science requires a total of 128-130 credit 
                    hours, of which 56-58 credits constitute an ITWS Core and 32 credits are devoted to a concentration. The 
                    remaining credit hours fulfill Rensselaer degree requirements. The ITWS core requirements establish a 
                    solid foundation for applying ITWS to any discipline. The Rensselaer requirements ensure the degreeâ€™s 
                    breadth and its consistency with long-established Rensselaer traditions. The required concentration provides 
                    an opportunity for in-depth study of an ITWS application area. Concentration options include arts, computer 
                    networking, data science, law, information security, management information systems, medicine, psychology, web 
                    technologies and numerous others. In consultation with a faculty adviser, students may also design their own 
                    concentration through the selection of courses that match their individual interests.

                    The specific requirements for the B.S. in Information Technology and Web Science are illustrated below. 
                    Both a professional and research track are offered for the B.S. in ITWS degree. For the research track, 
                    the capstone course is replaced with a two-semester thesis.</p>
